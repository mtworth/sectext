# SEC Filings Text Analytics

This Streamlit app allows users to search millions of SEC 10-K filings for keywords and visualize trends. The app provides an easy-to-use interface for querying the EDGAR database and displaying the results in a bar chart. Users can also download the search results as a CSV file.

2. Specify the start year and end year for the search.
3. Click the "Search Filings" button to start the search.
4. The app will display a bar chart showing the number of filings per year containing the specified keywords.
5. Use the "Download Results CSV" button to download the search results as a CSV file.
6. Use the "Download Chart as PNG" button to download the chart as a PNG image using the menu in the top righthand corner of the chart.
